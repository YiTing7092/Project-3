      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Yi-Ting Lin. I come from Taiwan, a small island in Asia.
        I've been in US since 2015 summer, the reason I came to US is that I'd like to
        explore my life and experience the differnt culture and new things. I hope I can
        find a job about website management or database management, so I still cannot
        decide my specialization.
      </p>
      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>
        I am kind of shy, but when you get to know me then maybe you'll have
        different opinions about me. I'm not a talkative person, but I have the
        patience to listen. welcome to talk with me if you need someone to
        listen to you.
      </p>
      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        I like to watch Japanese animations and live game on Youtube. Hunter X
        Hunter is my favorite animation. I've watched people playing Minecraft
        for a long time, but I am just a beginner to this game.
      </p>
      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        Collecting postcards is one of my hobbies now. Due to technology is very
        convenient I can use email or online phone to contact my family and
        friends, also I've never lived alone outside my country for a long time.
        The reason I start is not to forget how to write in Chinese therefore
        when I arrived new places I will purchase many postcards and send it to
        my friends and family. Now I had received many postcards from them!
